Welcome

Before you begin, we'd like to express our sincere gratitude to you for wanting to add a task to Flash.
With Flash our aim is to create a great user experience, enabling awesome advanced applications with just a few lines of code.
We're really pleased with what we've achieved with Flash and we hope you will be too.
Now let's dive in!

Tutorials
=========

The Task template is designed to guide you through contributing a task to Flash.
It contains the code, tests, and examples for a task that performs classification with a multi-layer perceptron, intended for use with the classic data sets from scikit-learn.
You should copy the files in ``flash/template`` to get started.

The tutorials in this section will walk you through all of the components you need to implement (or adapt from the template) for your custom task.

- :ref:`contributing_data`: our first tutorial goes over the best practices for implementing everything you need to connect data to your task
- :ref:`contributing_task`: now that we have the data, in this tutorial we create our custom task
- :ref:`contributing_optional`: this tutorial covers some optional extras you can add if needed for your particular task
- :ref:`contributing_examples`: this tutorial guides you through creating some simple examples showing your task in action
- :ref:`contributing_tests`: in our final tutorial, we cover best practices for writing some tests for your new task
